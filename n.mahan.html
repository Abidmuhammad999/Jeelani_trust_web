        What we need to do is to regain the original purity of our hearts and become truly human. Only then can we die
        happily as humans with clarity. What I am showing you is the way up there. Quthbuzzaman has shown us the path to
        elevate those who approach with sincere intention, by nurturing the divine qualities within, and lead them to
        the
        lofty state of being God's most excellent creation. That is what I continue to do. It is the method of spiritual
        purification that will continue until the Day of Judgment. Quthbuzzaman taught us to look at the heart of a
        person, regardless of caste or creed. It is when one attains that blessed state of mind that one achieves
        complete
        success in life. That is what I guarantee.
